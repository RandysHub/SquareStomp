Welcome to Square Stomp! A game where you and a buddy, (or not, don't worry we don't judge)
STOMP SQUARES. 

You get one point for each square stomped. The first to 10 squares stomped, wins!

## How it works and my journey
---
Square Stomp was created mainly using HTML Canvas. 


## Getting Started

## Technologies

-  HTML5
-  CSS3
-  Javascript

## Coming Soon
---
- The buttons in the results screen, actually working.
- A timer for both game modes mainly for single player.
- Three difficulty settings for single player based on how long you have to stomp the squares.
- Fix the bug where you get more than one point.
- Stun opponent when stomped on three times and health is depleted. 
- Display health.
- Add faces to the squares. (**URGENT**)
